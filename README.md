    A <b>Gradle plugin</b> that aids in compiling <a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">FlatBuffers</a> sources with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, written in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org">Kotlin</a>.
</p>

## üí° Introduction

This plugin was developed originally for [Exflo](https://github.com/41north/exflo).

## üôà Usage

To apply the plugin, use the gradle plugin syntax:

```groovy
plugins {
    id("dev.north.fortyone.flatbuffers") version "0.1.0"
}
```

Once the plugin is applied, you can configure it with the following options (default values are displayed below):

```groovy
flatbuffers {
    dockerCommand.set("docker")
    extraDockerOptions.set("run --rm")
    flatcDockerImage.set("41north/flatbuffers:1.11.0")
    extraFlatcArgs.set("flatc")
    language.set(Language.JAVA)
    inputSources.set(emptyList())
}
```

A `flatbuffers` source set will be available like a regular `java` or `kotlin`, so you can add your source code like usual.
